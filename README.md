## Things To Work On

#### By Noah Gottlieb

### Focus

My main focus today was _algorithms_! One of my biggest weaknesses in programming is being able to apply algorithms solve my problems efficiently. I will usually create a function that works but is usually full of fat and bad practices.

### Goal for the day

My goal for the day is as follows and will be documented through screenshots/commits:

1. Spend half of my day completing freeCodeCamps beginner and intermediate algorithms.

2. Study how proper cases to use specific algorithms and why one is better than others.

3. The last half of the day would be continuing with algorithm studies but in the context of whiteboard/interview questions.

### End of the day reflection and looking forward.
