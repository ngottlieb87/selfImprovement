## Things To Work On

#### By Noah Gottlieb

### Focus

My main focus today was _algorithms_! One of my biggest weaknesses in programming is being able to apply algorithms to solve my problems efficiently. I will usually create a function that works but is usually full of fat and not well optimized for the problem i need to solve.

### Goal for the day

My goal for the day is as follows and will be documented through screenshots/commits:

1. Spend half of my day completing freeCodeCamps beginner and intermediate algorithms.

2. Study proper cases to use specific algorithms and why one more suited for a task than another.

3. The last half of the day would be continuing with algorithm studies but in the context of whiteboard/interview questions.

### End of the day reflection and looking forward.

It was good to sit down and tackle algorithms again. I found that some of my functions were verbose when their was a cleaner simpler solution. An example was when i had to right a function to remove falsys from an array. I wrote nested for loop that made comparisons and would remove the falsys. All i had to write was: return arr.filter(Boolean); Done!

What i need to do is just practice over and over. The more i code the more i learn and retain. It's like any other skill and i just have to practice more throughout the week. It's hard when i get home because there's so little time left in the day but i know its extremely important to get these basic algorithms down.

### Setup

* You can fund my screenshots in the image folder and i tried to label them so you had an idea of what i was studying/programming.
